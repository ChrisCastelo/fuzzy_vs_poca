## Kane and Abel: AIs that play games

<br>CM3070: Computer Science Final Project
<br>By Chris Castelo


### PROJECT INTRODUCTION
The following is a project to the final project of the BSc Computer Science - Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence degree of the University of London. 

It aims to explain the motivations and details behind this project as well as the chosen template. 

#### Template
The chosen template is the Artificial Intelligence template "Kane and Abel: AIs that play games."

#### Motivations
The primary motivation for this is to learn and explore in-depth advanced methods of
collaborative training for AIs and implement those techniques within the constraints of natural
motion, which can be utilized in video game production.
After analyzing a few examples of newly implemented methods for such approaches, we find that
in most cases, Machine Learning based AIs are portrayed within realms of the unnatural motion
constraints, as often they are trained with simple boxes that come to life through simple motion
constraints. One can argue that this method is used to optimize training. However, the resulting
AI behavior, although coherent to expectations of intelligent AI, is often not equivalent to those
we would see in a shipped game with traditional state machine-based AI. The proposition for this
project is to train our Machine Learning based AI within the realms of natural motion given by the
constraints of a humanoid biped to obtain greater quality in movement and behavior.
